# Reference Manager

Emacs plugin to generate bibliography file automatically from a given plugin using various other libraries.
Also added functionality for browing gscholar with *eww*.

This is a work in progress and I hope I'll be able to continue it for some time. This is my attempt to integrate all manner of article browsing, reading and archiving from inside of emacs.

The references are extracted from a pdf using allenai's [science parse](https://github.com/allenai/science-parse).

I'm running it from localhost but it can be edited in the file. DBLP fetching code is derived from [gscholar-bibtex](https://github.com/cute-jumper/gscholar-bibtex)
